# MedChartSys
I'm embarking on the creation of a medical charting system, and my first step is to establish a database. I'm utilizing myPHP for this task. Attached is a draw.io Entity Relationship Diagram outlining the structure of my database. As I progress, adjustments may be necessary.

My ultimate objective includes developing both a mobile application and an augmented reality (AR) application. I've observed videos demonstrating the rendering of three-dimensional medical images in AR, prompting me to consider integrating real-time patient status updates alongside these images. Additionally, envision crafting a serene Zen garden within the Apple Vision Pros, providing a tranquil escape from the hospital's hustle and bustle while charting.
